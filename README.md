newtab-bookmarks
================

Chrome extension replacing the default startpage with your bookmarks.



Features ideas
=========================
- Indexing page text to better search bookmarks ( curl/jqeury-get, cached locally)
- Use a bookmark model (OOP)
- Persist the bookmark collection locally (localStorage)
- Website thumbnail: Integrate an ugly service (easy solution)
- Sync the bookmarks to a server (so we know how many users has bookmarked the same sites)
- Add domain filters (See all links from a given site)
- Url classifications (ie. a person website, a media, an open source-projet)
